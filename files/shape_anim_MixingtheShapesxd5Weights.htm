               the way to create animation with shapes is to animate the weight of each shape. Weighting
               is always done in relation to another shape key. This means that shape keys have to
               be overlapping in time with at least one other shape key to be weighted. 
            </p>
            <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-C628B852-CAA0-468B-BB6D-2777351335DF"></a></span>The higher the weight value, the more strongly a clip contributes to the combined
               animation. For example, if you set the weight's value to 1, the clip's contribution
               to the animation is 100% of its weight. 
            </p>

                     <span class="char_link"><a href="shape_manager_AnimatingtheShapes.htm">Animating the Shapes</a></span>) or the animation mixer (see <span class="char_link"><a href="shape_anim_MixingtheShapesxd5Weights.htm#WS5D22904DD940DF4B81E23C96D0B1457F-0080">Animating the Shape Weights Against Each Other</a></span>). This also includes using the power of compound clips, as described in <span class="char_link"><a href="shape_anim_MixingtheShapesxd5Weights.htm#WS5D22904DD940DF4B81E23C96D0B1457F-008B">Weighting with Compound Clips</a></span>.

                     use the Cluster Shape Combiner. It controls how strongly deformations and transformations
                     applied to the different clusters "pull" the points in the cluster. See <span class="char_link"><a href="shape_anim_MixingtheShapesxd5Weights.htm#WS5D22904DD940DF4B81E23C96D0B1457F-008D">Mixing between Clusters</a></span> for more information.

               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-40B345FB-6EB8-4E8C-B8F1-3B6F8BDE5464"></a></span>One of the most important things to understand about weighting is to know whether
                  weights are normalized (averaged) or additive. You'll know that shapes are normalized
                  if they seem to average or "smooth" each other out, or different clusters on the same
                  object affect each other when they shouldn't (such as an eyebrow affecting the mouth
                  shape). 
               </p> 
               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-057724DC-EC90-4E16-B7B7-C2C7F8822BE0"></a></span>When shape weights are normalized, the weight is divided by the sum of the weights
                  of all clips at the current frame (weighted average) so that the sum is always equal
                  to 1. This averaging results in a shape that is between the sources of the clips that
                  affect the object at the current frame.

The shapes are literally added together to create a composite
                  result. You can also exaggerate shapes by setting weight values higher than 1. 
               </p> 
               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-46736E6D-01FE-4E01-82D3-685F29A677E3"></a></span>The (B) shape is a <span class="MenuCascade" id="GUID-DD585148-37BE-4150-AF57-5822B4A0DBBA">Normalized</span> mix of Shapes 1 and 2. The shapes are averaged resulting in a combination of the
                  shapes. The total weight value of the two shapes equals 1.

               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-292881BC-EFA9-46C0-A9AE-0104D2518965"></a></span>In many cases, you probably want the weight to be additive instead of normalized,
                  such as if you're mixing different clusters on a face over the same frames. With additive
                  mixing, the shapes are literally added together to create a composite result. With
                  additive mixing, you can exaggerate shapes by setting values higher than 1.

               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-07663F2F-DF49-4AC5-A849-42EA9E3CF484"></a></span>In Softimage, you can easily create different sets of shape animation (each set in
                  a compound clip) and use different types of weighting. You could have the shapes within
                  each set be normalized, and then use additive weighting between the sets. For example,
                  if you're lip-syncing a character, you can create one compound of normalized phoneme
                  shapes and another compound of normalized facial expression shapes. Then using additive
                  weighting between these two compounds, you can have the character speak with the facial
                  expressions added "on top" of the lip-syncing.

                  the Shape Mixer property editor, or for a compound clip using the Cluster Shape Combiner
                  property editor (see <span class="char_link"><a href="shape_anim_MixingtheShapesxd5Weights.htm#WS5D22904DD940DF4B81E23C96D0B1457F-008D">Mixing between Clusters</a></span>).

                  animation, they simply contain a static pose. To prevent blocky, jerky movements,
                  you need to blend the animation between different shapes with weighting. Weighting
                  is always done in relation to another shape clip. This means that if you want to weight
                  a shape, it has to be overlapping in time with another shape. 
               </p> 
               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-D938A859-D144-48F7-8057-B7D75188CECD"></a></span>Weighting is usually easiest using the default range of 0 to 1, where 0 is no weight
                  and 1 is full weight (this makes it easier to figure out percentages). However, you
                  can also set mix weights outside this range: use negative values to move points in
                  the opposite direction, or use a value above 1 for more extreme movements. If you
                  deselect the <span class="MenuCascade" id="GUID-2993BD66-192E-410A-8EC3-CD3F73A93AA1">Normalize</span> option in the mixer's property editor, as shown above, you can "overshoot" the data

                  A has a weight of 1 and Clip B has a weight of 1.5 at a given frame, then A's influence
                  is 40% (1 Ö (1 + 1.5)) and B's influence is 60%. See the previous section, <span class="char_link"><a href="shape_anim_MixingtheShapesxd5Weights.htm">Mixing the Shapes' Weights</a></span>, for more information.

                  This lets you have multiple clusters on the same object and then weight the clusters
                  against each other. To use facial animation as an example, you can mix between upper
                  and lower lip clusters to create a myriad of shape combinations, or mix between the
                  whole face and the eyebrows.

                  clips to tweak the animation.

                  at a time. For example, if you want to check just the animation of the cheeks, you
                  can mute the lower and upper lip compound clips so that their clusters aren't used
                  in the shape animation.

                  at once; for example, you can scale it or offset it using the compound clip. You can
                  even copy a compound shape from one model to another (see <span class="char_link"><a href="shape_anim_SharingShapeAnimationbetweenObjectsModelsandScenes.htm#WS5D22904DD940DF4B81E23C96D0B1457F-00C2">Copying Shape Presets between Models or Scenes</a></span>).

                  more clusters) or not, is by using the Cluster Shape Combiner operator, which is created
                  as soon as one shape clip is created in the mixer. This operator provides you with
                  two weights you can control for each cluster on an object that has shape animation.

                  You can modify the weight so that the points are pulled only half as strongly by the
                  target shape or even produce exaggerated shapes that overshoot the target.
