               </h2> 
               <p>There are some nodes in the Get Data category that return time data:</p> 
               <ul>
                  <li> 
                     <p>Current Frame returns the local frame number, or the global frame if Global is true.</p> 
                  </li>
                  <li> 
                     <p>Current Time returns the local time in seconds, or the global time if Global is true.</p> 
                  </li>
                  <li> 
                     <p>Simulation Step returns the length of a frame in seconds. It is equivalent to getting
                        PlayControl.Rate and doing the math yourself.
                     </p> 
                  </li>
               </ul> 
               <p>During a simulation, the local time is the time for which the simulation has been
                  active. The first frame that the simulation is active is 0, and corresponds to the
                  initial state.
               </p> 
               <p>The global frame is always the value of the current frame in the playback panel.</p> 
            </div>
            <div class="section"><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="WSB74EE070EB80114199F4C921243896F3-0085"></a></span> 
               <h2><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-48E18332-DE96-4DC9-AF2C-164912F571CC"></a></span>Age
               </h2> 
               <p>The Age attribute of particles is in seconds, and is automatically incremented every
                  frame by the simulation environment. The Age of new points is automatically randomized
                  to a fraction of a frame by the Emitter compounds.
               </p> 
               <p>The Clone Point node and compounds that include it (such as the Spawning compounds)
                  copy the Age attribute. If you want newly cloned points to have a different age, you
                  must set it using the On Creation or Execute on Spawn ports.
               </p> 
            </div>
            <div class="section"><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="WSB74EE070EB80114199F4C921243896F3-0086"></a></span> 
               <h2><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-033448DD-48C0-4351-9805-C23DD182E2FB"></a></span>Sub-frame Simulations
               </h2> 
               <p>Simulations are calculated on a per-frame basis. However, a frame can be a long time,
                  especially when dealing with particle emissions and collisions. In many situations,
                  it becomes necessary to consider slices of time smaller than a single frame.
               </p> 
               <p>The SimulatedFrameFraction stores the portion of a frame for which a point has already
                  been simulated. The Simulate Particles node affects a particle for a length of time
                  equal to (1 – SimulatedFrameFraction)*SimulationStep, and then set the attribute to
                  1.0 so that the particle is unaffected by other Simulate Particles nodes for the rest
                  of the frame. SimulatedFrameFraction is reset to zero at the beginning of each frame.
               </p> 
               <p>The Emitter compounds automatically initializes SimulatedFrameFraction and sets it
                  to (1 – Age/SimulationStep) so that on its first frame of existence, a particle only
                  moves for a distance proportional to its age. As a result, it appears as if particles
                  have been emitted continuously throughout the frame instead of all at once.
               </p> 
               <p>You can set the SimulatedFrameFraction attribute directly. For example, suppose you
                  use the Basic Collide node to test for collision with a geometry. If a point will
                  collide, you can store the old value of SimulatedFrameFraction in a custom attribute,
                  say OldSFF. You can then set SimulatedFrameFraction to the value of Hit Frame Fraction
                  returned by the Basic Collide node and simulate up to the moment of collision. After
                  that, set SimulatedFrameFraction to OldSFF + Hit Frame Fraction before changing states
                  or doing something else for the rest of the frame.
               </p> 
               <p>The Get Remaining Frame Fraction and Get Remaining Seconds in Frame compounds can
                  also be useful when working with sub-frame simulations.
