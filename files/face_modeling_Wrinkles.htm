            <p>Face Robot cannot wrinkle any area of the face that doesn't have wrinkles already
               modeled into the mesh's geometry. The goal is to model the skin in its relaxed position
               and make sure to add sufficient geometry in the wrinkle areas so that the deformation
               can convincingly occur there.
            </p>
            <p>A good starting point is to look over the expressions that you want your character
               to have and model the wrinkles into the geometry with these expressions in mind. You
               may want to use a textured wrinkle map as a reference while you're modeling the wrinkles.

                     as possible. Rather than using even-distance parameterization, edge loops should be
                     placed closely together in areas of wrinkles to enhance the wrinkle effect.

                     areas like the nose scrunch and crows' feet.

                     flat and not creased). Carefully consider the distance between the wrinkles in the
                     mesh: if they are too far apart, you will need a lot of sliding motion in the animation
                     to bring them together which could look over-stretched. But if they are too close
                     together, they will wrinkle very sharply and look bad in the final result. Only add
                     depth to the wrinkles if they are permanently carved into the face in the neutral
                     pose, such as with older characters.
                  </p> 
               </li>
               <li> 
                  <p>For rendered projects, try to make the primary wrinkles in the mesh and use stress
                     maps to drive bump and displacement for fine wrinkles.
                  </p>
