            that is the correct size for the simulation, using the correct geometrical construction,
            and having the correct resolution. This has a big impact on the way that the cloth
            or curve is deformed in the simulation.

                     a Syflex simulation. As with other simulation calculations, scale is crucial when
                     dealing with Syflex simulated deformations. Before you start, you need to define what
                     unit of measurement a Softimage unit will mean in your world: 1 meter, 10 cm, 1 cm,
                     1 foot, etc. And you need to model your objects in reference to this and to make sure
                     that their mass or density also reflects this. 
                  </p> 
                  <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-3A43A961-2A7E-4162-A97C-E192137C33B5"></a></span>For example, if you create a cube to be 1 unit wide and you set its mass to 1 kg,
                     this is going to be an extremely dense cube if you define 1 Softimage unit as 1 cm.
                     On the other hand, if you define 1 Softimage unit to be 100 meters, the cube will
                     be as big as a football field, so 1 kg would be lighter than air.

                     are certain limitations. For example, a tiny cloth object with hardly any mass should
                     be avoided because the calculations required may introduce numerical errors into the
                     simulation.

                     and edges being roughly the same size as each other. This is because every edge becomes
                     a spring in the simulation, with additional cross-bracing springs to keep polygons
                     from shearing. The more regular the polygons, the more regular the springs, and the
                     more predictable the results.

                     such as leather, large faces work well; for silk, it's better to use smaller faces.

                     to bend in a more predictable way.

                     you want torn edges, it's better to add them as textures instead of modeling them.

                     from moving like real fabric. There are no springs where there are no polygons, and
                     edges only have springs on the mesh side, so the cloth tends to look too stiff.

            <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-AA214BC9-892E-4EC6-A710-8A8A54E60EA8"></a></span>The cloth's resolution not only affects the speed of the simulation, but also the
               behavior of the cloth. A cloth whose resolution is either too high or too low can
               change the behaviour. The first step is to find out what resolution you need to make
               the geometry behave as you want in the simulation. For example, just getting the cloth
               to solve correctly in collisions is a good place to start. 
            </p> 
            <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-D25154FF-0117-4CA1-B711-D0580AA7DC1E"></a></span>As with all simulations, the trick is to find the lowest resolution acceptable for
               the results you want. One way to accomplish this is to use an acceptable low-resolution
               "stand in" model while you're setting up the basic simulation and collisions, which
               is faster. Then swap in the high resolution mesh for the render (with more details
               like pockets.) The simulation mesh drives the render mesh with a hull or cage deformer.

                     want. For example, if you want silk draped over a chair, the resolution needs to be
                     higher than for a piece of burlap. However, the more subdivisions on the cloth, the
                     more complex the spring calculations.

                     making the clothes baggier than normal which should help to create more wrinkles in
                     those areas.

                           resolution is too low, edges may penetrate some polygons of the collision object even
                           if the vertices are well managed.

                           might be offset.

                     the cloth model. As with all standard objects, a cloth object inherits the animation
                     from its parent. When making clothes for characters, it's generally a good idea to
                     make the skeleton root the parent of the cloth object.

                     of pant legs) if the cloth bunches up or wrinkles in such a way that the boundary
                     edge of the clothing touches the collision object (arms, legs): this can allow the
                     clothing to pass through the collision object. Try creating with cuffs to avoid this,
                     or make the cloth stiffer.

                     ths simulation. Pre-collision intersections will have those area's normals facing
                     away from each other, and once simulated, the cloth will never collide correctly with
                     the body in those areas.

                     before it assumes an action. Keep the clothing away from the character's body so that
                     none of its surface penetrates the character's geometry in that pose. Then give a
                     pre-roll of however many frames you need for the character and the cloth to "settle"
                     together before the character's action begins. The character should ease into its
                     action.
