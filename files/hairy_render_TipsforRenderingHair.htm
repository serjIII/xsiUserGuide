               a few things to keep in mind. Like all things rendered, you want to achieve the best
               look possible for the least amount of rendering time.
            </p>
            <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-476419F3-8948-485F-BC0D-37172CAD064B"></a></span>To make working on hair go faster, you can often use many "expensive" parameters with
               low values while you're working, but then set the values higher when you're ready
               to test out the rendering.
            </p>
            <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-AFAEBECB-B18F-40EA-BBF2-54C5BCE869E4"></a></span>Here are some general tips, but all suggestions are relative to the look you're creating
               for your hair or fur.
            </p>
            <div class="section"><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="WS07FF3F5C1F4F2D4E8CBED7D77B97646A-0094"></a></span>

               </h2> 
               <ul>
                  <li> 
                     <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-C200DB07-F8B6-4484-82FD-C0326A081F62"></a></span>The overall number of hairs has a big impact on the render time. Depending on the
                        look you need to achieve, try to reduce the overall number of hairs as much as you
                        can and instead increase the root and/or tip thickness (see <span class="char_link"><a href="hairy_renderhairs_SettingtheRenderHairThickness.htm">Setting the Render Hair Thickness</a></span>). Using a slight kink or frizz can also help in giving the illusion of more hair.

                        render you'll probably want to reduce the hair thickness and increase the number of
                        hairs (<span class="MenuCascade" id="GUID-E37AC505-AE88-4A18-AD98-1624B9FBCD5D">Total Hairs</span> value — see <span class="char_link"><a href="hairy_renderhairs_ConnectingMapstoRenderHairParameters.htm">Connecting Maps to Render Hair Parameters</a></span>). Very thick hair strands can penetrate each other and cause flickering.

                        to achieve. However, it's generally better to increase the number of render hairs
                        instead of using larger values for the Strand Multiplier, which can slow down the
                        rendering time.
                     </p> 
                  </li>
                  <li> 
                     <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-984AEEC9-FB8A-4CEF-A1EB-5605EC023528"></a></span>For animals or complex hair, use more hair objects (that is, apply hair separately
                        to several clusters) instead of using one hair object for the whole animal or head.
                        Having several hair objects makes it faster to style, test, and render because you're
                        always working in smaller pieces, which allows you more flexibility.
                     </p> 
                  </li>
                  <li> 
                     <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-E3B01DDB-7BE2-4BF0-983E-B1DBDE47C637"></a></span>Comb the hairs by a small amount in one direction. If hairs lie on top of each other,
                        you don't need as many hairs to cover up any bald spots.
                     </p> 
                  </li>
                  <li>

                        you can create a density map (see <span class="char_link"><a href="hairy_renderhairs_RemovingRenderHairsDensity.htm">Removing Render Hairs (Density)</a></span>) so that there are more hairs only where you need them, such as for doing close-ups
                        on an animal's head. Density maps prevent hair from being generated where the value
                        is 0, and if a hair isn't generated, it isn't rendered.
                     </p> 
                  </li>
                  <li>

                        You may find that higher values (such as 20 or more) are needed when the hair style
                        is very long, frizzy, or curly. Short hair/fur can go as low as 8 (or less) for the
                        final render.
                     </p> 
                     <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-57E92717-AAF0-4F12-91A6-6E29FC2A058F"></a></span>However, the price for precision is rendering time, as high segment values can slow
                        down a scene. Use lower values of 2 or 5 for quick previewing and interaction while
                        you're styling the hair. See <span class="char_link"><a href="hairy_renderhairs_SettingtheRenderHairResolutionSegments.htm">Setting the Render Hair Resolution (Segments)</a></span> for more information.

                        the hair strands. This is generally used to create or enhance a shadow effect on hair.

                        and very low for light hair. Of course, this depends on the specific effect you're
                        trying to achieve.

                     <ul>
                        <li>

                              the hair color and texture at a distance. This lets you use fewer real hairs but still
                              have a full look. Having the underlying skin of the object textured with an image
                              that looks like hair can help tremendously because you can use a lot less hair and
                              still have the same visual complexity.
                           </p>

                        required look of hair without rendering time being unreasonable.

                  to consider:
               </p> 
               <ul>
                  <li> 
                     <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-F7B4B989-BCD6-437D-B502-0363462E3A95"></a></span>White hair is not white: it's chromatic gray. There are lots of tints of "off white"
                        in white, but if you have the color turned to pure white (1), you won't have much
                        variation. You can use the <span class="MenuCascade" id="GUID-7DFAE9A3-19A6-46ED-B308-FEA46DF49351">Color Variation</span> option in the <span class="char_link"><a href="shaderpresets698.htm">Hair Shading</a></span> shader to achieve subtle color changes
                     </p> 
                  </li>
                  <li> 
                     <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-1F56628C-30E4-4CB5-89B4-B87339D892C2"></a></span>You don't want to fill up the whole color spectrum range with the base color — you
                        need to allow a little room for the specular color (which is additive). The white
                        should be brighter than anything else in the frame, so make sure your subject and
                        background don't compete.
                     </p> 
                  </li>

                        is very little diffuse range, which means that the hair's shading is mostly the base
                        color — anything else comes from shadows.
                     </p>

                        diminish the effect of the diffuse shading. In other words, the shaded hair (pre-shadow)
                        is just the base hair color with no dark-to-light variation.
                     </p>

                        in the traditional sense because the setting doesn't affect the shadow density.
                     </p>

                        of hair strands with a fairly high transparency value. This also decreases shadowing
                        because it allows light to pass through the hair volume. Having a very low transparency
                        value for the roots can make the hairs opaque and look like hair plugs.

                        shadows (see <span class="char_link"><a href="hairy_render_LightingandShadowsforHair.htm#WS07FF3F5C1F4F2D4E8CBED7D77B97646A-0050">Shadow-mapped Shadows</a></span>).

                        values to over 0.2 to give the best results.

                        regular shadows. If you're using shadow maps, you can use the scan line method which
                        is faster than raytracing.

                        Min -1/Max 1 and progressively reduce the threshold until you reach an acceptable
                        quality. Settings of 0/2 often give good results.

                        good quality image. Try using the Mitchell filter with a 4/4 size for a good speed
                        while retaining much of the image's sharpness.

                        hitting a hair increases when you bump up the minimum aliasing level.
                     </p>

                        Increasing the number of samples per pixel will give you different results since,
                        statistically, more hairs should get hit by sampling rays.

                        there is no sampling setting just for hair, you could render the hair in a separate
                        pass so that the other objects in the scene can use lower sampling levels.

Draw small render regions on the hair as you go so that previews
                        are fast.
