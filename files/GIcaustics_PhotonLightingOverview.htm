                  it either bounces (if the object is reflective), is transmitted (if the object is
                  transparent or translucent), is absorbed (if the object is opaque), or does a little
                  of each.
               </p> 
               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-4ECAA13D-6EE3-4E96-9A95-1690757CEAF7"></a></span>In the case of a bounce, the light ray once again travels in a straight line until
                  it hits another object, and the cycle repeats â€” with each bounce, the ray gets weaker
                  until it is invisible. When a light ray is absorbed, some of the color of the object
                  is bounced back away from the object. For example, a bright red ball in the middle
                  of a white room causes a subtle red bleed on the white floor.
               </p> 
               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-D9658107-DFAA-4D73-9E58-FCC9BD72E4A5"></a></span>In Softimage, real-life lighting is simulated with global illumination. Global illumination
                  includes both direct and indirect lighting caused by diffuse reflections. Photon (or
                  light) rays emanate from the light source in all directions and bombard the scene.
                  When these photons hit an object, some stick and others are reflected and refracted.
                  These reflected and refracted rays go on to illuminate other surfaces.
               </p> 
               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-6E35A990-E257-47D6-82A6-E5A03FA07DB8"></a></span>The underside of a table, for example, is not completely dark, even if it is not illuminated
                  directly by a light or reflections from a shiny surface. With global illumination,
                  no ambient light is shed, which is a non-directional light that pervades a scene.

               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-7FA099C7-6BE4-40F2-9A68-E20DCCE1413A"></a></span>Caustics are light patterns created when light illuminates a diffuse surface by reflection
                  or refraction: for example, a bright patch under a magnifying glass, reflections on
                  a wall from a mirrored disco ball, or shimmering highlights under rippling water.
               </p> 
               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-05186E9E-A10B-428F-BA4C-C72A9BD1DC58"></a></span>Caustics are a subset of full global-illumination simulation where photons are only
                  emitted toward any caustic-generating objects in the scene. These photons are then
                  reflected or transmitted by these objects until they hit diffuse surfaces in the scene.
                  When a photon hits a caustic-receiving object, it is stored in a caustic Photon Map.
                  Photons are stored only on diffuse surfaces, so the caustic-receiving objects must
                  have a diffuse component in the reflection model.
               </p> 
               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-D6EE5298-C3C4-4FAD-931D-89C6C8633351"></a></span>Materials of caustic-emitting objects specify if and how photons hitting this object
                  should continue. In addition, the materials of caustic-receiving objects decide how
                  to "pick up" photons absorbed by the object during processing.

                     reflection) and the sum of reflection and transparency has to be close to or larger
                     than 1.

                  and the photon continues to trace indirect lighting information.

                  specularity, are transparent, refract light, or any logical combination of these.
                  A photon stops bouncing (is absorbed) when it hits an object that neither receives
                  nor transmits the effect.

                  or transmit the effects. And from the Render Options property editor, you can control
                  the number of bounces that a photon makes. See <span class="char_link"><a href="GIcaustics_SettingPhotonCastingReceivingandVisibility.htm">Setting Photon Casting, Receiving and Visibility</a></span> for more information.

                  of where photons are stored in the scene. You can save a Photon Map so that when you're
                  happy with the way your scene looks, you can avoid having to recalculate it every
                  time you render a scene.

                     most other settings, where ranges often go from 0 to 1 or 1 to 100, when working with
                     photons you'll be specifying high numbers: 1000, 10 000, 100 000, 500 000, or more.
                     The more photons there are in the scene, the longer it takes to render.
                  </p> 
                  <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-21596CDD-FEF4-49F0-89C2-2892B5D9CE4E"></a></span>To do all their bouncing around, photons need energy. In addition to a good breakfast,
                     you need to specify a numerical strength for them so that they can bounce from object
                     to object, as well as have an effect on distant objects. Photons leave energy behind,
                     which creates the photon effect, every time they "stick" to a surface.
                  </p> 
                  <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-AC6630C0-0798-4C23-94F6-2627F126CC09"></a></span> <span class="MenuCascade" id="GUID-8B211C39-0C66-4905-99BC-7B9385FD0D6C">Energy Intensity</span> controls the brightness of the effect. Each photon uses an equal amount of the energy
                     specified. For example, 1000 photons use 1/1000th of the photon energy. Generally,
                     the farther objects are from the light source, the more energy each photon needs.
                     Again, you'll be working with large numbers: 100, 1000, 10 000, 100 000, 1 000 000,
                     and more.
