         <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-CC9921D0-EA95-4C55-8D46-23257FCF9778"></a></span>Animation layers allows you to have two or more levels of animation on an object's
            parameters at the same time. You usually want to layer animation when you need to
            add an offset to the main animation (base layer) on an object, but you don't want
            to change that animation. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-32906FF3-9C09-4350-8613-46EBA66556F0"></a></span>Layering lets you add keys on top of the existing base animation, which can be either
            fcurves, expressions, linked parameters, or an action clip in the mixer, such as a
            mocap clip. You must have animation on the object's parameters before you can create
            an animation layer on top of them. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-2257DEE1-2AC1-4FB0-82E2-FC072836727E"></a></span>For example, let's say that you've imported a mocap action clip of a character running
            down the flight of stairs. However, in your current scene, the stairs are shallower
            than those used for the mocap session, so the character steps "through" the stairs
            instead of on top of them. To fix this problem, you create an animation layer, offset
            the contact points for the character's feet so that they step on the stair, adjust
            the body's position, then set keys. The result is an offset animation that sits on
            top of the mocap data: you don't need to touch the original mocap clip at all. You
            can then easily edit the fcurves for the animation layer, tweaking it as you like.
            
         </p>
         <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-FEE790F5-9646-429B-A2FB-8B81C274D005"></a></span>Animation layers are like applying offset keys in the mixer, except that using animation
            layers is much faster and more intuitive than using the mixer. This means that you
            don't need to turn your animation into action clips in order to blend animation or
            add offsets, which makes for a faster and more natural animation workflow. As well,
            you can see where the offset keys are placed for each layer because they're displayed
            in the timeline. 
         </p>
         <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-307D1381-4615-4090-8A21-9239E04F4DA7"></a></span>Animation layers are also non-destructive, meaning that they don't alter your base
            animation in any way: the keys in the layers always remain a separate entity. This
            allows you to experiment with different effects on your animations and build several
            variations of a move, each in its own layer.

            <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-AE091FED-2A87-4E55-BF7F-0E2AFEF27D4D"></a></span>Animation layers are actually controlled and managed in the animation mixer, but you
               don't need to access the mixer for creating and setting keys in layers. Using the
               options in the Animation Layers panel (on the KP/L tab on the main command panel),
               you can create layers and then set keys with your usual keying workflow. 
            </p> 
            <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-42C888FD-7FB5-43AA-B94C-66BEC0CA2EA4"></a></span>While you don't need to open the animation mixer for setting keys in layers, you do
               have the option of using the mixer for added control, such as setting each layer's
               weight. 
            </p> 
            <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-6A76EF5D-B98D-4A41-A95C-16A770C40182"></a></span>Because animation layers use the animation mixer, it's best to create models before
               starting to animate. Mixers are created one per model, so if the object you're animating
               isn't in a model, its animation layers remain in the animation mixer created at the
               level of the scene (in the scene_root's Mixer node), which can be restrictive.
