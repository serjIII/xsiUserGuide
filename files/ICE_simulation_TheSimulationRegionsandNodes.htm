               can be evaluated in different ways that are appropriate to the task that you're doing.
               Traditionally, there are regions for Modeling, Animation, Shape Modeling, and Secondary
               Shape Modeling. If you're working with simulated ICE trees, however, there are two
               more construction regions that are created: Simulation and Post Simulation.

            <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-941CC2C9-F8DE-4A55-8763-3A222F21DA1F"></a></span>The Simulation and Post Simulation regions are used only for ICE simulations and appear
               automatically when you create a Simulated ICE Tree node (operator). Currently, only
               particles and deformation operators can have simulated ICETree nodes.

                  previous frame rather than on the results of the construction regions that are below
                  it. This is what differentiates a simulation from other types of modifications to
                  an object. For example, if you use a Push deformation on a sphere, at each frame the
                  Push operator gets the undeformed sphere and applies the push. If you move one frame
                  forward, the Push gets the undeformed geometry again and applies the same push. 
               </p> 
               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-315CBD90-672E-42AD-96EB-1E3324224DD8"></a></span>The only way to modify the push deformation over time is to animate its parameters.
                  However, if the Push operator is in the Simulation region, at each frame it takes
                  the results of the sphere's pushed points from the previous frame and pushes them
                  out more. As you play the simulated push, you see the sphere gradually inflating,
                  without any animation being defined. The only way to return to the undeformed sphere
                  is to go back to the first frame. 
               </p> 
               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-989E8A09-2368-484E-86AA-05F57F14D101"></a></span>When a simulation is active, the regions below the Simulation region are not re-evaluated.
                  This means that if you have any operators in the Animation region, those operators
                  are not evaluated again after the simulation is active. If you want to return to using
                  the animation operators instead of the simulation, simply select and delete the Simulation
                  marker from the stack so that there's no Simulation region.

                           the fraction of a frame that has already been simulated for a point. Setting this
                           value to 1 prevents points from being resimulated by other Simulate nodes in the same
                           tree (such as the Simulate Rigid Bodies node) or in other trees on the same object.

                           to (1 â€“ Age/SimulationStep) so that on its first frame of existence, a particle moves
                           only for a distance proportional to its age. As a result, it appears as if particles
                           have been emitted continuously throughout the frame instead of all at once.

                     the particles, but it also lets you make particles into PhysX rigid bodies, which
                     are objects that do not deform in a collision. The node updates a particle's position,
                     velocity, orientation, and angular velocity from the previous frame based on its rigid
                     body attributes (such as elasticity, friction, shape, size, and scale).

                     with other objects that are set as obstacles. You can also create springs and dampers
                     between points on objects that have the Simulate Rigid Bodies node in their ICE tree.

                     SimulateFrameFraction attribute because the PhysX dynamics engine doesn't work on
                     frame fractions to detect collisions: it uses whole frames only.

                     means that if the Simulate Rigid Bodies node is plugged into the ICETree node, you
                     don't need the Simulate Particles node to also be plugged in.

                     Simulate Rigid Bodies node is if some of the particles are acting as rigid bodies
                     while others are acting as "regular" particles, and you switch between each type of
                     simulation at some point (such as by using a state system or an If node and setting
                     a condition for switching).
