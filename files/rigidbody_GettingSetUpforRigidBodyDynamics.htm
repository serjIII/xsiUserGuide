                        a rigid body simulation. As with other simulation calculations, scale is crucial when
                        dealing with rigid bodies. Before you start to do a rigid body simulation, you need
                        to define what unit of measurement a Softimage unit will mean in your world: 1 meter,
                        10 cm, 1 cm, 1 foot, etc. And you need to model your objects in reference to this
                        and to make sure that their mass or density also reflects this. 
                     </p> 
                     <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-3A43A961-2A7E-4162-A97C-E192137C33B5"></a></span>For example, if you create a cube to be 1 unit wide and you set its mass to 1 kg,
                        this is going to be an extremely dense cube if you define 1 Softimage unit as 1 cm.
                        On the other hand, if you define 1 Softimage unit to be 100 meters, the cube will
                        be as big as a football field, so 1 kg would be lighter than air. 
                     </p>

                  <li> 
                     <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-57CB95E9-5CE5-46AD-BC01-88A1F0733C7F"></a></span>Both the PhysX and ODE dynamics engines have been tuned so that 1 Softimage unit is
                        equal to 10 cm. 
                     </p> 
                  </li>
                  <li> 
                     <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-75650824-1FCB-4413-BDFC-807BB25B9816"></a></span>If possible, try to make the rigid bodies in your simulated world have sizes of 1
                        to 10 Softimage units, masses of 1 to 10 kilograms, and have moderate velocities (such
                        as between 10 and 50 Softimage units per second). Having extremely large, extremely
                        small or thin, or very fast moving objects can make the simulation less stable, or
                        may require you to use many substeps for an accurate simulation. 
                     </p>

                        there are certain limitations. Infinite and very small values, such as an object with
                        hardly any mass or density, should be avoided because the calculations required may
                        introduce numerical errors into the simulation.

               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-E478AE70-342E-40AB-8D95-5DD8FD23157A"></a></span>Scale also applies to gravity. Gravity is a constant that is the same for all objects
                  regardless of their mass: every object falls at exactly the same rate. However, everything
                  changes at the moment the object collides with another because that's where its mass,
                  energy, and momentum play a major role. 
               </p> 
               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-12936FFB-E5C2-4727-B356-A709C6BE84B2"></a></span>To have the correct gravitational behavior from the objects, the size of the objects
                  in the scene must be taken into consideration. For example, the default gravity setting
                  is 98.1, which is earth's gravity if you define 1 Softimage unit as 10 cm. However,
                  if you define 1 Softimage unit as 1 meter, you would need to set the gravity to 9.81.
                  
               </p> 
               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-F5605EA7-F3A5-4EB3-9F91-3D351429A0A6"></a></span>In Softimage, the default gravity is set to 98.1 because most characters are modeled
                  with a scale of 1 unit equalling 10 cm, which is basically the scale used for the
                  default Softimage rigs and models.
