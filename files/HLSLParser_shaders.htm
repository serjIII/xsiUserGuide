            <p>Most of the HLSL shaders provided with Softimage are from the NVIDIA Shader Library.
               There are a wide range of shaders including skin, natural effects, metals, post processing
               effects, and more. The HLSL effects files are located in the Application\phenolib\hlsl
               folder of the Softimage installation path. You can copy and modify these effects files
               to build your own.
            </p>
            <p>For more information about working with effects shaders in Softimage, see <span class="char_link"><a href="rt_cgfx_hlsl.htm#WS4F13F53798BA3F4FA5B9631E4DB3180B-0001"> CgFX and HLSL Shaders</a></span> [<span class="char_link"><a href="rt_cover.htm">Realtime Shaders</a></span>].

               </p> 
               <p>Brick pattern, with controls, using texture-based patterning. The lighting is purely
                  lambert and from a directional source, so it's done in the vertex shader. (1 technique/s).

               <p>3D mesh cage effect, created by procedural texturing. Texture is pre-calculated by
                  HLSL. Wires are aligned to world coordinates. (1 technique/s).

               <p>3D checkerboard effect, created by procedural texturing. Texture is pre-calculated
                  using the HLSL virtual machine. (1 technique/s).

               </p> 
               <p>Align as a quad to screen according to the original tex coords. As a sprite, best
                  applied to simple quads with 0-1 tex coords. Then apply "Numbers.dds" as a stream
                  of number textures to create an apparent numeric counter driven by the vertex shader.
                  (1 technique/s).

               </p> 
               <p>This effect file uses 3d checker patterns to illustrate a number of important coordinate
                  systems and shading vectors. #define USER_COLORS if you want to use parameters instead
                  of the fixed macro colors. (8 technique/s).

               </p> 
               <p>This effect file uses colors to illustrate a number of shading vectors. That is, values
                  that are typically important in shading. This effect can often help find bogus parts
                  of models, or be used to explore the contents of a model. (15 technique/s).

               </p> 
               <p>This effect is intended to look like pen crosshatching. It was inspired by the British
                  Museums Durer exhibit of 2003. Some of Durer's most famous drawings were made in two
                  colors of ink on medium-colored paper. The diffuse shape rendering was drawn in cross-hatches
                  in a dark ink. (2 technique/s).

               </p> 
               <p>Gooch shading with glossy highlight in HLSL ps_2 pixel shader. Textured and non-textured
                  versions are supplied. (2 technique/s).

               </p> 
               <p>A lambertian-like surface with light "bleed-through" (appropriate for soft translucent
                  materials like skin). The "subColor" represents the tinting acquired by light diffused
                  below the surface. Set the "Rolloff" angle to the cosine of the angle used for additional
                  lighting wraparound. The diffuse effect propogates based on the angle of LightDirection
                  versus SurfaceNormal. Versions are provided for shading in pixel or vertex shaders,
                  textured or untextured. (4 technique/s).

               </p> 
               <p>A phong-shaded metallic surface lit from either a point or directional source. Versions
                  are provided for textured, untextured, quadratic falloff or not. (4 technique/s).
               </p>

               </p> 
               <p>Simple sinusoidal vertex animation on a phong-shaded plastic surface. The highlight
                  is done in vertex shading and not as a texture. Textured and Untextured versions are
                  supplied. (2 technique/s).

               </p> 
               <p>A phong-shaded plastic-style surface lit from either a point or directional source.
                  Versions are provided for textured, untextured, quadratic falloff or not. (4 technique/s).
               </p>

               </p> 
               <p>Creates the illusion that the surface is covered with a thin film of transparent material,
                  as in oily water, thin shellacs, dirty layered ice, etc. (1 technique/s).
               </p>

               </p> 
               <p>A helpful tool for artists to optimize their texture sizes, so that textures created
                  by artists won't be too small (looks bad) or too big (wastes time on texture details
                  that will never be seen). To use: (1) Look for regions where desired texture resolution
                  is dominant, (2) set desired size for the "Reso" parameter, (3) and select the "TexRez"
                  techniques. (6 technique/s).
