            <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-CC93B830-3DCC-4C83-BC2E-712A9056C16D"></a></span>Although particles are usually simulated, you can also work with them as unsimulated
               point clouds. You can affect a point cloud in different ways depending on the region
               of the construction stack in which the ICETree and other operators reside: Simulation
               or Post-simulation (see <span class="char_link"><a href="ICE_simulation_TheSimulationRegionsandNodes.htm">ICE Simulation Regions and Nodes</a></span>), Modeling, and Animation. 
            </p>
            <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-18561469-639C-463B-B3E2-E53045FCADE9"></a></span>The Animation and Modeling regions are below the Simulation region which means that
               operators in these regions are not re-evaluated while the simulation environment is
               active. You must move to the first frame of the simulation (its default initial state)
               to see the effect of MoveComponent and other operators that are in these regions.
               
            </p>
            <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-061DD906-7512-4435-A0AE-E56EED93CA30"></a></span>If the ICETree operator is in the Modeling or Animation region, it is unsimulated
               and you can use the point cloud as you can any other object: select, move, rotate,
               scale, or deform it. You can emit points to create a point cloud, or you could add
               points to the cloud, delete points from it, or create clusters of points. 
            </p>
            <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-BDB97209-3FA1-44A1-8702-DB8BBC502C14"></a></span>If you're moving points and using proportional modelling, be aware that the Consider
               Neighborhood option is on by default. This option only works when points are connected,
               which they aren't when they're in a point cloud. Make sure to turn this option off
               to be able to use proportional modelling correctly. 
            </p>
            <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-8295349B-234F-49E9-A986-FC013309AA90"></a></span>You can also animate the unsimulated points in different ways. For example, you could
               emit particles in the Modeling or Animation region (see below), then use the Animated
               options in any of the Turbulize and Randomize compounds to animate the points. This
               can be useful if you want to animate unsimulated particle strands using the Strand
               Sine Wave and Turbulize Strand compounds. You can also apply dynamics on unsimulated
               strands to create movement. See <span class="char_link"><a href="ipart_strands.htm">ICE Particle Strands</a></span> for more information.

               <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-6054AC0C-5593-4DE2-BDD4-8AA8FA3E4063"></a></span>If you create simulated particles, you can freeze the point cloud, then add a new
                  ICE tree to control its movement, such as by deforming it. To freeze the point cloud,
                  select it and click the <span class="MenuCascade" id="GUID-53E82E34-F9FD-4AB8-BDCF-DD180F1B827B">Freeze</span> button at the bottom of the MCP panel. This gets rid of all operators in all construction
                  regions. The particles are no longer simulated and you can use them as regular points.

                  a number of particles in the Modeling region and then freeze the point cloud. The
                  particles are simply emitted, but they don't move because their positions are not
                  being changed and updated at each frame (not simulated).

                  emission instead of a certain amount emitted per second as is often done in a simulation
                  (see <span class="char_link"><a href="ICE_particles_ICEParticleRateAmount.htm">ICE Particle Rate (Amount)</a></span>).

                  you can apply standard object-based deformations to them.

                  Twist, or Taper) to point clouds. This is a powerful way of making complex particle
                  systems, especially when combined with forces. For example, you could make a whirling
                  tornado by containing a particle system within a twisted and tapered lattice and then
                  applying a vortex force; or have a school of fish deform along a curve.

                     and freeze the point cloud. This way, all the particles needed for the deformation
                     are available in the state you want by frame 1, and the number of particles in the
                     cloud remains constant because there's no emission. You can then apply deformations
                     to the point cloud to sculpt it, including shapes and envelopes.

                     it, you can create clusters. If you create clusters, you can constrain objects to
                     them and you can use deformations to modify them, as well as envelopes or shape animation.
                     You can also animate the clusters individually by constraining them to an animated
                     object, such as a null.
