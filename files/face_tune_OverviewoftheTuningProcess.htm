               through an elegant abstraction of facial anatomy and a model of how the soft tissue
               of the face deforms. It allows you to work with many aspects of facial deformation
               including cheek bulging, nose flaring, lip curling, and wrinkled skin. 
            </p>
            <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-7338E9A5-49BD-4255-820B-7895A9B1880A"></a></span>Regional face deformers are key elements of the soft tissue model, which is an underlying
               concept of Face Robot. These deformers correspond roughly to the different muscle
               groups of the face. They deform different areas of the face to simulate tissue compression,
               such as the way a cheek creases with a smile, or the way a cheek puffs from inflating
               the inside of the mouth. The deformers interact with modeled and weight-painted wrinkles
               and folds on the mesh. 
            </p>
            <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-78FAE31F-37AE-4DF1-9F16-F53CF9CC6825"></a></span>The tuning stage is nonlinear, and the order in which you do things depends largely
               on personal taste and workflow. You can use any process you like in Face Robot to
               achieve the results you need: painting weights, sculpting, region deformers, or shape
               animation. You will probably need to adjust the deformation as the animation goes
               along. Face Robot makes it easy to go back and forth between the Act and Tune panels
               as you like to continually refine your work.

                  make sure that you have an array of reference materials to verify the accuracy of
                  the soft tissue model. These materials can include motion capture data that indicates
                  range-of-motion, as well as digital photographs, high-resolution 3D scans, clay maquettes,
                  or concept sketches of the facial expressions you want your character to achieve.

                     and for wrinkling — see <span class="char_link"><a href="face_modeling_ModelingtheHead.htm">Modeling the Head</a></span> for more information.

                     you want to hit the "big ticket" items first: make sure the mouth is working as you

                           painting: this allows you to define how big or small each muscle region is, as well
                           as the relative amplitude of the muscle.

                     area is behaving properly. 
                  </p> 
                  <p><span class="anchor_wrapper"><a name="GUID-E93AA2BF-42F9-4374-8CEB-DFEC6C08E504"></a></span>Move the animation controls around in each region of the face, or move them into an
                     extreme pose (such as moving the mouth corners in a smile position). Then sculpt that
                     region to have the optimum amount of deformation for each pose, one area at a time.

                           an "ooh" shape), you can use the standard shape animation tools on top of the mouth
